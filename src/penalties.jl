    AbsLog{p}

Penalty type for

    φ(r) = |log(r)|^p  if r > 0
           0           if r = 0

The discontinuity at r=0 prevents zero entries in A from sending the objective
value to infinity.

This leads to convex optimization problems in log space. `AbsLog{1}` typically
has a flat minimum-basin in which members of an entire family of solutions are
equally good. `AbsLog{2}`, except in degenerate cases like `[0 1; 1 0]`, has a
unique minimum.

"""
    AbsLinear{p}

Penalty type for `φ(r) = |1 - r|^p`. Unlike [`AbsLog`](@ref), this penalty is
continuous at `r = 0` (`φ(0) = 1`), so zero entries in `A` naturally contribute a
constant penalty.

The resulting optimization problems are non-convex and may have multiple local
minima.

    cover_objective(ϕ, a, A)

Compute the cover objective `∑_{i,j} ϕ(|A[i,j]| / (a[i] * b[j]))` for the given
penalty function `ϕ`. The two-argument form is for symmetric matrices where the cover
is `a*a'`.

Zero entries of `A` are handled according to `ϕ`:
- `AbsLog{p}`: zero entries contribute 0 (φ(0) = 0 by convention).
- `AbsLinear{p}`: zero entries contribute 1 (φ(0) = |1-0|^p = 1).
